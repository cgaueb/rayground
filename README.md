### Description

Rayground is a web-based framework for rapid prototyping of algorithms based on the ray tracing paradigm. Its main goal is to help develop, test and share self contained modules that showcase a particular method or technique.

Rayground aims to demystify raytracing fundamentals, by providing a well-defined WebGL-based programmable graphics pipeline of configurable distinct raytracing stages coupled with a simple scene description format.

### Prerequisites

Rayground is open, cross-platform, and available to everyone. It does not rely on any browser plugins and thus runs on any platform that has a modern standards compliant browser. Specifically, the website runs only on WebGL2-enabled browsers and requires the `EXT_color_buffer_float` extension. 

### Aim

The goal of this github account is twofold: 
- Inform the active users what new [features](https://github.com/cgaueb/rayground/projects) are coming in the next version(s) of the website.
- Offer accessibility for bug reporting, enhancements or feature [requests](https://github.com/cgaueb/rayground/issues).

### Example Projects

- Ambient Occlusion
- Whitted Path Tracer
- Shirley (first, Second book)
- Sampling Comparison Example 
- Post processing 

### Research

**Motivation**. The advent of mass-produced, consumer grade hardware with raytracing acceleration capabilities has significantly boosted the interest of the graphics community and has led to the introduction of related methods to interactive applications, thus demonstrating its wide applicability to students. Unfortunately, this turn of interest to ray-tracing-based techniques is not sufficiently backed by proper educational tools to assist students in becoming familiar with the basic concepts and help them become practically engaged in building their own projects. Moreover, modern low-level graphics APIs, either dedicated to ray tracing like NVIDIA OptiX or supporting it, such as Microsoft DirectX 12 and Khronos Group Vulkan, pose high entry barriers to students and require a very daunting and long learning process, riddled with many distracting technicalities.

**Idea**. In [VGV+20], Rayground is used as an online, interactive education tool for richer in-class teaching and gradual self-study by providing a convenient introduction into practical ray tracing. In this work, an extensive discussion is offered describing how both undergraduate and postgraduate computer graphics theoretical lectures and laboratory sessions can be enhanced by Rayground, in order to achieve a broad understanding of the underlying concepts.
