# RayGround.com

Rayground is a web-based framework for rapid prototyping of algorithms based on the ray tracing paradigm. Its main goal is to help develop, test and share self contained modules that showcase a particular method or technique.

### Prerequisites

The website runs only on WebGL2-enabled browsers where the extension `EXT_color_buffer_float` must be enabled, if the device supports it.

### Aim

The goal of this github account is twofold: 
- Inform the active users what new [features](https://github.com/cgaueb/rayground/projects) are coming in the next version(s) of the website.
- Offer accessibility for bug reporting, enhancements or feature [requests](https://github.com/cgaueb/rayground/issues).
